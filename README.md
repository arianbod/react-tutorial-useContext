# Context + Custom Hook Tutorial Project

## Description

This React application demonstrates the use of React Context along with a custom hook for state management. It's a simple yet powerful example of how to create a global state using React Context and access it across components using a custom hook.

## Features

- Implementation of React Context for global state management.
- Custom hook (`useGlobalContext`) for seamless access to the global state.
- `useState` for local state management within components.

## Installation

Ensure you have [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) installed on your system before starting.

Follow these steps to set up the project:

### Clone the Repository

\```bash
git clone https://github.com/arianbod/react-tutorial-useContext
cd react-tutorial-useContext
\```

### Install Dependencies

\```bash
npm install
\```

### Start the Development Server

\```bash
npm run dev
\```

This will typically start the server on `http://localhost:5127`.

## Project Structure

- `main.jsx`: The entry point of the React application.
- `App.jsx`: The main application component.
- `AppContext.jsx`: Defines the React Context and the global state provider.
- `Context.jsx`: Contains the custom hook `useGlobalContext`.

Example from `App.jsx`:

\```jsx
import { useState } from 'react';
import AppContext from './Context.jsx';

function App() {
    const [count, setCount] = useState(0);
    // ... rest of the code
}

export default App;
\```

## Usage

The application initializes with a default global state value, which is then accessible and modifiable across components via the `useGlobalContext` hook.
